The project contains three example Jupyter notebooks (the hands on tutorial will focus on example 1):

- ``example_1_introduction.ipynb`` - An introduction to **PyAutoFit**'s core features.
- ``example_2_lensing.ipynb`` & ``example_3_topological_models.ipynb`` - An Astronomy example which uses strong gravitational lensing to illustrate topological model composition with **PyAutoFit**.

The hands-on tutorial is scheduled for **3pm (coopenhagen time) Thursday 27th May**.
